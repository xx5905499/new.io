<!--
Simple html page that creates a clock for old phones with old browsers.
Save this file in a folder (eg. as clock.html) on your computer, then
start a web server in a terminal window from that folder.

A simple way to do this is open a terminal window and move to the folder
holding the script (don't type '$', that's your prompt):
    $ cd path/to/folder

Now find the IP address <addr> of your computer:
    $ ipconfig getifaddr en0

You should get an address such as "10.0.1.4". If not, try en1 instead of
en0. Next start up the web server. If you have Python installed, you can
try one of these commands:
    $ python -m http.server 8080
or
    $ python3 -m http.server 8080
or
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

depending on whether you have Python 3 or Python 2 available.

Once running, go to the web browser on your phone and enter the link:
    http://<addr>:8080/clock.html
where <addr> is the IP address found earlier, eg 10.0.1.4

You should see a black screen with large red numbers with the correct
time. Pinch to zoom in or out to have the numbers fill the screen, plug
in the phone to keep it charged, adjust the brightness, prop it up, and
you're all set. You'll get bigger numbers with the phone on its side. 

You can now close that terminal window since your phone will keep the
page running internally. Make sure you set up your phone settings so
that it doesn't shut off when plugged in.
